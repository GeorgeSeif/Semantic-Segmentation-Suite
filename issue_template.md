### FAQs

- **Question:** I got an `InvalidArgumentError` saying that `Dimensions of inputs should match` **Answer:** See issue #17

- **Question:** Can you upload pre-trained weights for these networks? **Answer:** See issue #57

- **Question:** Do I need a GPU to train these models? **Answer:** Technically no, but I'd highly recommend it. I was able to train the models pretty well in about a day using a 1080Ti GPU. Training on CPU would take much longer than that.

- **Question:** Will you be adding the FCN or U-Net models? **Answer:** No I won't be adding those simply because they're a few years old and state-of-the-art has moved past that.
