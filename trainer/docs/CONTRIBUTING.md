# Contributing Guidelines

All pull requests which improve the code or add new features are welcome!

## Rules

(1) Try to follow the same style as the code base

(2) Supports python 3 as a minimum. But if it also supports python 2, awesome!

(3) Should not break anything

(4) If you are contributing a new network from a paper, make sure you test it with all of the frontends (ResNet, Inception, MobileNet). It's alright if it doesn't work with a couple of them, just be sure to report it and note it down

(5) Make sure your new code doesn't break anything. Test it thoroughly

## Requested Contributions

The following requests have come up quite frequently in GitHub and would be great for a pull request:

(1) New segmentation networks

(2) New feature extraction front ends

(3) Support for TensorFlow Eager Execution

(4) A script to convert grey scale datasets to colour

(5) Support for exporting the saved checkpoints to a TensorFlow graph pb file
